Monte Carlo tree search is a probabilistic search algorithm. Itâ€™s a unique decision-making algorithm because of its efficiency in open-ended environments with an enormous amount of possibilities.

Monte Carlo tree search applies [Monte Carlo method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method) to the game tree search. As it is based on random sampling of game states, it does not need to brute force its way out of each possibility. Also, it does not necessarily require us to write an evaluation or good heuristic functions.
